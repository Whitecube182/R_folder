Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}

```

## Project librarys

This project are using a couple of librarys, they are the following:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(psych)
```

NB! We will add any library we add and check it at the end to assure that the project is not missing any dependencies.

Feel free to add commenting on any of these projects.

## Data wrangling

We start our project out by downloading data from refinitive. The data is stored as a excel file that has been stored in the project folder. To make it possible to work with in r we start by importing the file.

```{r}
index_emerging_markets <- read_excel("FTSE 20.09.23 - EOH.xlsx", skip = 6)
glimpse(index_emerging_markets)
```

This code tells r to read the excel file in our folder, however skip the first 6 lines as they are not of any use to use. The dataset is now recognized as a tibble with 241 rows and 7 columns. By using glimpse we can see that the type of data is \<dttm\> (the date of the observation) and the rest are \<dbl\> (that dates current value).

The data is downloaded in US dollars and the 20 year frame is from 19 september 2003 and 19. September 2023.

From this point we want to normalize the data so we have a fair comparison point with the base of 100. In order to do so we are using the following line:

```{r}
normalized <- index_emerging_markets |>
  mutate(
    FTSEWorldN = FTSEWorld / (146.2 / 100),
    IndiaN = India / (332.5 / 100),
    EgyptN = Egypt / (59.04 / 100),
    ChinaN = China / (672.28 / 100),
    BrazilN = Brazil / (150.65 / 100),
    TaiwanN = Taiwan / (182.21 / 100),
  )
```

The code above adds 6 new columns where the data is normalized and starts at 100 on the 19. September 2023.
